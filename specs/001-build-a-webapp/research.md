# Research Findings: Hotel Website Technology Decisions

**Date**: September 18, 2025  
**Feature**: Hotel Website with Booking System  
**Phase**: 0 - Technology Research and Decisions

## Navigation and Routing

### Decision: React Router v6 with BrowserRouter
**Rationale**: 
- Provides declarative routing perfect for SPA navigation
- Excellent TypeScript support and type-safe route parameters
- Built-in support for nested routes (future expansion capability)
- Standard solution in React ecosystem with strong community support
- Handles browser history and URL state management automatically

**Alternatives considered**:
- Native browser routing: Too basic for SPA state management needs
- Hash routing: Poor SEO and user experience compared to browser routing
- Manual history management: Reinventing the wheel with potential bugs

**Implementation approach**:
```jsx
// Route structure with horizontal navigation
/             → Home/Landing page
/rooms        → Rooms listing page  
/packages     → Package offerings page
/amenities    → Hotel facilities page
/booking      → Reservation form page
```

## State Management Architecture  

### Decision: React Context API + useReducer for global state
**Rationale**:
- Booking state needs sharing across multiple components and pages
- Context API avoids prop drilling through component hierarchy
- useReducer provides predictable state updates for complex booking flow
- Zero additional dependencies aligns with minimal library requirement
- Easy to test and reason about state transitions

**Alternatives considered**:
- useState only: Requires extensive prop drilling, becomes unmaintainable
- Redux Toolkit: Violates minimal dependencies requirement
- Zustand: Additional dependency conflicts with user requirements

**Implementation approach**:
```jsx
// State organization
BookingContext: reservation data, guest info, selected room/packages
UIContext: navigation state, modal visibility, loading states  
Local useState: component-specific state (form inputs, validation)
localStorage: session persistence for booking draft
```

## Form Handling and Validation

### Decision: Controlled components with custom validation hooks
**Rationale**:
- Direct React approach without external libraries per user requirements
- Full control over validation timing, error messages, and user experience
- Better integration with booking state management context
- Easier to customize for hotel-specific validation rules
- TypeScript provides compile-time validation of form schemas

**Alternatives considered**:
- React Hook Form: Additional dependency violates minimal libraries requirement  
- Formik: Complex setup and additional dependency
- Uncontrolled components: Less predictable state management for complex forms

**Implementation approach**:
```jsx
// Custom validation patterns
useFormValidation hook: reusable validation logic
Email validation: HTML5 validation + custom regex patterns
Phone validation: Custom formatting and international support
Date validation: Check-in/out logic with availability integration
Required field validation: Real-time feedback with accessibility support
```

## CSS Architecture and Styling

### Decision: CSS Modules with custom properties (CSS variables)
**Rationale**:
- Scoped styles prevent global conflicts between components
- Native Vite support, no additional build configuration required
- Maintains familiar CSS syntax and debugging experience
- Excellent TypeScript integration with typed CSS modules
- CSS custom properties enable consistent theming and responsive design

**Alternatives considered**:
- Plain CSS: Risk of global style conflicts in larger application
- Styled Components: Additional dependency and runtime overhead
- Tailwind CSS: Additional dependency and learning curve
- Sass/SCSS: Additional build complexity

**Implementation approach**:
```css
/* File organization */
src/styles/
├── globals.css          # CSS reset, custom properties, base styles
├── components/          # Component-specific CSS modules
└── pages/              # Page-specific CSS modules

/* CSS custom properties for theming */
:root {
  --color-primary: #2c5282;
  --color-secondary: #ed8936;
  --spacing-unit: 8px;
  --border-radius: 4px;
}
```

## Responsive Design Strategy

### Decision: CSS Grid + Flexbox with mobile-first media queries
**Rationale**:
- Native CSS solutions align with minimal dependencies approach
- Excellent browser support across target browsers
- CSS Grid perfect for room/package card layouts
- Flexbox ideal for navigation and form layouts
- Mobile-first ensures progressive enhancement

**Alternatives considered**:
- Bootstrap: Violates minimal dependencies requirement
- CSS-in-JS solutions: Additional complexity and runtime overhead
- Float-based layouts: Outdated and harder to maintain

**Implementation approach**:
```css
/* Breakpoint strategy */
/* Mobile-first base styles: 320px+ */
@media (min-width: 768px) { /* Tablet */ }
@media (min-width: 1024px) { /* Desktop */ }

/* Key responsive patterns */
Navigation: horizontal desktop → collapsible mobile menu
Room grid: 3 columns → 2 columns → 1 column  
Booking form: side-by-side → stacked layout
Hero sections: full viewport → scaled appropriately
```

## Component Architecture

### Decision: Functional components with custom hooks
**Rationale**:
- Modern React patterns with hooks provide better code reuse
- Easier testing and reasoning about component lifecycle
- Better TypeScript integration and type inference
- Custom hooks enable logic sharing between components
- Aligns with React team's current recommendations

**Implementation approach**:
```jsx
// Component hierarchy
App → Router → Layout → Pages
Layout: Navigation + main content area + Footer
Pages: Room listing, Package listing, Amenity listing, Booking form
Shared components: Button, Input, Card, Modal, LoadingSpinner
Custom hooks: useBooking, useForm, useLocalStorage
```

## Asset and Image Management

### Decision: Vite native asset handling with responsive images
**Rationale**:
- Built into Vite bundler, no additional configuration required
- Automatic asset optimization and URL generation
- Support for modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
- Tree-shaking for unused assets
- Easy import syntax in components

**Alternatives considered**:
- External CDN: Adds complexity for development and deployment
- Image optimization plugins: Additional dependencies

**Implementation approach**:
```jsx
// Asset organization
public/images/
├── rooms/              # Room photography
├── amenities/          # Facility images  
├── packages/           # Package hero images
└── common/             # Logos, icons, backgrounds

// Responsive image implementation
<img 
  src="/images/rooms/deluxe-mobile.webp"
  srcSet="
    /images/rooms/deluxe-mobile.webp 320w,
    /images/rooms/deluxe-tablet.webp 768w,
    /images/rooms/deluxe-desktop.webp 1024w
  "
  alt="Deluxe Ocean View Room"
/>
```

## Data Persistence Strategy

### Decision: localStorage with Context API integration
**Rationale**:
- Persists booking progress across browser sessions
- No server dependency required for initial version
- Simple JSON serialization for complex booking objects
- Excellent browser support across target platforms
- Easy migration path to server-side persistence later

**Alternatives considered**:
- sessionStorage: Data lost when user closes browser
- IndexedDB: Overkill for simple key-value storage needs
- Cookies: Size limitations and complexity for large objects

**Implementation approach**:
```javascript
// Storage strategy
'hotel-booking-draft': in-progress booking information
'hotel-user-preferences': UI state, room filters, accessibility settings
'hotel-recent-searches': search history for better UX
// Auto-save booking progress every 30 seconds
// Clear completed bookings after confirmation
```

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright (future)
**Rationale**:
- Vitest: Native Vite integration, extremely fast test execution
- React Testing Library: Encourages accessibility-focused testing
- No additional configuration required with Vite
- Jest-compatible API for easy developer adoption
- Playwright for future end-to-end testing when needed

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Requires additional ESM configuration with Vite
- Cypress: More complex setup and additional dependencies

**Implementation approach**:
```javascript
// Test organization and coverage
tests/
├── components/         # Component unit tests (RTL)
├── pages/             # Page integration tests
├── hooks/             # Custom hook tests  
├── utils/             # Utility function tests
└── integration/       # User flow tests (future Playwright)

// Testing priorities
1. Booking flow critical path
2. Form validation and error handling
3. Navigation and routing behavior
4. Responsive design breakpoints
5. Accessibility compliance
```

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Vite code splitting + React.lazy for route-based splitting
**Rationale**:
- Meets constitutional performance budget requirements
- Vite provides excellent bundling optimization out of the box
- React.lazy enables route-based code splitting without additional libraries
- Tree-shaking eliminates unused code automatically
- Easy to implement and maintain

**Implementation approach**:
```jsx
// Route-based code splitting
const Home = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/Home'));
const Rooms = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/Rooms'));
const Booking = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/Booking'));

// Bundle analysis and optimization
- Vite bundle analyzer for size monitoring
- Dynamic imports for large utility functions
- CSS code splitting by route
- Image lazy loading for below-fold content
```

## Development Tooling

### Decision: TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier configuration
**Rationale**:
- TypeScript provides compile-time error catching and better IDE support
- ESLint with React and accessibility rules enforces code quality
- Prettier ensures consistent formatting across team
- All integrate seamlessly with Vite and VS Code
- Supports constitutional quality requirements

**Implementation approach**:
```javascript
// Tool configuration
TypeScript: strict mode enabled for maximum type safety
ESLint: React hooks rules + jsx-a11y for accessibility
Prettier: consistent formatting with project standards
Vite: optimized build configuration for performance budget
```

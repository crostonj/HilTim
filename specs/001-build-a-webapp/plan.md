   ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check PASS
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   ⏳ IN PROGRESS
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md
   ⏳ PENDING
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section

## Summary
Hotel booking website featuring 4 main pages (Rooms, Packages, Amenities, Booking) with horizontal navigation and reservation functionality. Built as a React SPA using Vite with minimal dependencies, focusing on clean CSS styling and responsive design. User arguments specify: "The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use React, CSS"

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript with React 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite (build tool), React, React Router (navigation)  
**Storage**: Local state management (React Context), localStorage for persistence  
**Testing**: Vitest (Vite's testing framework), React Testing Library  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
**Project Type**: web (frontend SPA following Option 2 structure)  
**Performance Goals**: <3s load time, <250KB JS bundle, <100KB CSS, Lighthouse >90  
**Constraints**: Minimal dependencies per user requirements, CSS-only styling, responsive design  
**Scale/Scope**: 4 main pages, booking flow, static content, progressive enhancement

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - frontend directory with organized React structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - React Router setup and configuration patterns
   - React Context vs external state management approach
   - Form validation patterns without external libraries
   - CSS organization strategy (modules vs plain CSS)
   - Vite configuration for optimal performance

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research React Router v6 best practices for SPA with 4 main pages"
   Task: "Find React Context patterns for booking state management"
   Task: "Research form validation in React without external libraries"
   Task: "Find CSS organization patterns for React + Vite projects"
   Task: "Research Vite optimization techniques for performance budget"
   Task: "Find responsive design patterns for hotel booking interfaces"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Guest (booking information)
   - Room (type, pricing, availability)  
   - Booking (reservation details)
   - Package (bundled offerings)
   - Amenity (hotel facilities)
   - State management patterns

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - TypeScript interfaces for all entities
   - Mock data structures for frontend-only version
   - Future API contract definitions
   - Component prop interfaces

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - TypeScript type validation
   - Component prop validation tests
   - Integration test scenarios
   - Mock data validation

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Navigation flow testing
   - Booking form submission scenarios  
   - Responsive design validation
   - Accessibility compliance tests

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Create .github/copilot-instructions.md for GitHub Copilot
   - Document React/Vite patterns and preferences
   - Include CSS organization guidelines
   - Add accessibility and performance requirements

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each TypeScript interface → type definition task [P]
- Each component → component creation task [P]  
- Each page → page implementation task [P]
- Integration tests for user flows
- CSS styling tasks for responsive design
- Vite configuration and optimization tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Types and tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Common components before pages, routing setup first
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent components)
- Performance optimization tasks after core functionality

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No violations requiring justification.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [ ] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)  
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS  
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved (from spec)
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none)

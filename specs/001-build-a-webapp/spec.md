3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: guest discovers hotel ‚Üí browses rooms/amenities ‚Üí makes reservation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable

- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A potential hotel guest visits the website to explore accommodation options. They navigate through different pages to learn about available rooms, packages, and amenities. After finding suitable options, they proceed to book their stay by providing necessary details and confirming their reservation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor arrives at the hotel website, **When** they use the horizontal navigation menu, **Then** they can easily access Rooms, Packages, Amenities, and Booking pages
2. **Given** a user is on the Rooms page, **When** they view room listings, **Then** they can see room types, descriptions, and pricing information
3. **Given** a user wants to make a reservation, **When** they access the Booking page, **Then** they can select dates, room type, and provide guest information
4. **Given** a user completes booking information, **When** they submit the reservation, **Then** they receive confirmation of their booking
5. **Given** a user browses packages, **When** they view package details, **Then** they can see what's included and pricing
6. **Given** a user explores amenities, **When** they visit the amenities page, **Then** they can learn about hotel facilities and services

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to book unavailable dates?
- How does the system handle incomplete booking information?
- What occurs if a user navigates away during the booking process?
- How does the site behave on mobile devices with the horizontal navigation?
